# AI Financial Insight Generator

Welcome to the AI Financial Insight Generator project! This project aims to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to provide valuable financial insights. By analyzing vast amounts of financial data, our AI system can generate accurate predictions, identify trends, and offer actionable recommendations.

1. Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as os, streamlit, and custom libraries from the langchain package.

2. Setting up API Key: The code sets the OpenAI API key by assigning it to the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

3. Initializing Components: Several components are initialized, including:

- llm: An instance of the OpenAI class from the langchain.llms module, which represents the OpenAI language model.
- embeddings: An instance of the OpenAIEmbeddings class from the langchain.embeddings module, which provides embedding models for text.
- loader: An instance of the PyPDFLoader class from the langchain.document_loaders module, used to load and split PDF documents.
- store: An instance of the Chroma class from the langchain.vectorstores module, which represents a vector store for document analysis.

4. Creating VectorStore Info: The code creates a VectorStoreInfo object that contains information about the vector store, including its name, description, and the actual vector store instance.

5. Creating VectorStore Toolkit: The code creates a VectorStoreToolkit object that serves as a toolkit for interacting with the vector store. It includes the VectorStoreInfo object and the language model (llm) as its components.

6. Creating Agent Executor: The code uses the create_vectorstore_agent function to create an agent executor. This function takes the language model (llm), the vector store toolkit, and other optional parameters to construct an agent that can generate responses based on user prompts.

7. Streamlit Application: The code sets up a Streamlit application by using the streamlit library. It creates a simple user interface with a text input field for the user to enter prompts.

8. Running the Agent: When the user enters a prompt, the code executes the agent by calling the run method of the agent_executor object. The response generated by the agent is then displayed in the Streamlit application.
